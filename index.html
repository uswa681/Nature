	Nature is the phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations.

	I love the sound of birds
so early in the morn,
I like the sound of puppies soon after they are born.

I love the smell of flowers
and the taste of honey from bees.
I love the sound the wind makes when it’s blowing through the trees.

I love the way the sky looks on a bright and sunny day,
and even when it’s rainy, I love the shades of gray.

I love the smell of the ocean, the sound of waves upon the sand,
I love the feel of seashells and how they look in my hand.

And when the sun is gone, I love the moon that shines so bright,
I love the sounds of crickets and other creatures of the night.

So when I lay me down to sleep, I thank the Lord above,
For all the things of nature and more, all the things I love.
